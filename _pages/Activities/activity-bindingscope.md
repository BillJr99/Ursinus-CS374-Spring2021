title: "CS374: Programming Language Principles - Binding and Scope"
excerpt: "CS374: Programming Language Principles - Binding and Scope"

info: 
  goals: 
    - To define the various ways that names can be bound to items such as variables
    - To explain interpreter or compiler binding of types
    - To differentiate between strongly and weakly typed languages
    - To define variable scope
    - To relate scope to a function call stack

      title: Binding
      questions:
        - "Can <code>foo</code> be re-assigned at runtime?  Would you say that it is statically or dynamically bound to its value?  How about <code>x</code>?"
        - "Do you think this is true of every language?"
        - "How many bindings are there of the identifier <code>x</code>?  If <code>x</code> is staically bound, it must be resolved by the compiler at compile time.  How is the correct value obtained at each reference?" 
        - "What would happen if <code>x</code> is re-declared in <code>foo</code> after it has already been declared in languages like C and Java that specify and insist on proper types (these are called strongly typed languages)?"

      title: Tracking Bindings
      questions:
        - "What kinds of information are needed to specify a bound symbol?"    
        - "What kind of data structure would enable a dynamic number of bound variables in a routine?"
        - "What revisions are needed to support additional data types?"
        - "What revisions are needed to support scope, so that variables of the same name can exist in subroutines?"

      questions:
        - "How can polymorphism work in a statically bound language?  How might this differ from a dynamically bound language?"

      title: Virtual Inheritance
      questions:
        - "A call to <code>x->Eat()</code>, where <code>x</code> is of type <code>Animal</code> but refers to a <code>Llama</code>, would output what?"
        - "How would this differ if <code>Eat</code> was not virtual, and implemented in the class <code>Animal</code>?"
